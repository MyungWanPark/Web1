    <h2>How to live the meaningful life?</h2>
    <p>
      Do For Others
      It's no great secret that giving to others improves our own feelings of purpose and meaning. Giving can take many forms, of course:
      donating our time, or our talents -- or simply lending a friendly ear.
      Helping others seems to be strongly correlated with increased life satisfaction. Lending a helping hand can provide a sense of purpose
      for us, young and old.
      One fascinating aspect of working for the benefit of others is that helping others improves both physical and mental health. In fact,
      studies show that involvement in community service activities is linked to living longer. [3]
      But volunteering once every now and then appears to be of little real use. If it is to have any meaningful impact, there is a threshold
      a person must meet when it comes to being of service to others.
      Giving our time in order to help others on a more regular basis, will bring the greatest rewards in terms of enhancing life's meaning,
      while maximizing our positive impact on the people with whom we come into contact.
      In short, helping and doing good for others is an important component of any meaningfully lived life -- it pays real dividends.
      Express Yourself
      Living a meaningful life is closely related to authenticity, to being who we truly are.
      Many people struggle to be themselves for fear of criticism or rejection; as a result, they find themselves living a life that is far from
      satisfying or meaningful. When we are not allowed -- for whatever reason -- to be who we truly are, we greatly diminish the meaning we can derive from the life we live.
      An excellent example of this is the recent transition, or gender affirmation, of Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner. Ms. Jenner lived her life
      for 65 years as someone whom she felt was not aligned with her true nature. Now that her gender affirmation is complete,
      she is at last able to express her authentic self, and in so doing, she is more able to live a life of greater meaning.
      Here, then, is another important factor in our ability to live a meaningful life: We must be willing to live in an authentic way, one that
      allows us to express who we truly are -- even if this takes courage.
