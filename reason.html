    <h2>The reason for the meaning</h2>
    <p>Why is meaning important to life?
      Because the energy invested in meaning allows you to connect with your deeper purpose. The more you engage with meaningful life, not only does it grow with time, it also provides you with a happy, fulfilling life. This is very different than pleasurable life that is transient, current, and illusory.
      Given our culture of consumerism, we regularly become a target of brain wash and "propaganda" of cultivating an hedonistic life instead of a meaningful life. This is because a meaningful life requires planning, ownership of our actions, and responsibility for the consequences of our choices. As a result, a meaningful life can be demanding and is often a stressful one. It is not as accommodating as a pleasurable life. Purposeful life requires us to be patience, to delay our gratification and to think long-term, which is against our second (acquired) nature, but a big part of our true nature.
