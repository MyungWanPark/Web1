    <h2>The meaning of my life</h2>
    <p>
      To my surprise, most of the people with whom I have talked about the meaning of life
      have told me that they did not think that their lives were meaningful enough.
      Many even presented their lives as outright meaningless. But I have often found the reasons
      my interlocutors gave for their views problematic. Many, I thought, did not pose relevant questions
      that might have changed their views, or take the actions that might have improved their condition.
      (Some of them, after our discussions, agreed with me.)
      Most of the people who complained about life’s meaninglessness even found it difficult
      to explain what they took the notion to mean.

      In other words, Landau thinks that people who feel purposeless actually
      misunderstand what meaning is. He is among many thinkers over the ages who’ve wrestled
      with the difficult question, “What is a meaningful life?”
